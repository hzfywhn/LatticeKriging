This is simplified rewrite of LatticeKrig package on Cartesian geometry.

Both R and MATLAB codes can be used for perform spatial modeling for scalar and vector fields,
but R codes are more efficient by a better design of the sparse matrix decomposition.

R codes can be used for real applications and MATLAB codes are suitable for demonstration purposes.
